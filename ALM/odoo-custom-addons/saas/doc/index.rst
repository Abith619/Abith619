Installation
============

* Use ``db-filter=^%d$`` when using Same Instance type in saas.operator model
* Set ``--limit-time-cpu`` and ``--limit-time-real`` big enough (e.g. 1800 and
  3600), because with default values (60 and 120 seconds) it may be not enough
  to install modules in template database
* Set ``--workers`` more than 1 (you cannot use *threaded* mode, i.e. ``--workers`` equal to zero)
* Follow instruction of `Job Queue <https://github.com/OCA/queue/tree/12.0/queue_job>`__ module.
* `Install <https://odoo-development.readthedocs.io/en/latest/odoo/usage/install-module.html>`__ this module in a usual way
* Restart the odoo as required by the Job Queue module
