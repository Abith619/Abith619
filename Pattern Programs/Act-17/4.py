"""Craps is a popular dice game played in casinos. Write a program to play a variation of the game, as 
follows: Roll two dice. Each die has six faces representing values 1, 2, â€¦, and 6, respectively. Check 
the sum of the two dice. If the sum is 2, 3, or 12 (called craps), you lose; if the sum is 7 or 11 
(called natural), you win; if the sum is another value (i.e., 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10), a point is established. 
Continue to roll the dice until either a 7 or the same point value is rolled. If 7 is rolled, you lose. 
Otherwise, you win. Your program acts as a single player. 
Here are some sample runs. 
You rolled 5 + 6 = 11
 You win 
You rolled 1 + 2 = 3 
You lose 
You rolled 4 + 4 = 8 point is 8
 You rolled 6 + 2 = 8 
You win 
You rolled 3 + 2 = 5 point is 5 
You rolled 2 + 5 = 7 
You lose"""
