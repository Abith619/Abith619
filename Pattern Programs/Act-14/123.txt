Unix-based operating systems typically include a tool named cat, which is short for concatenate. 
Its purpose is to concatenate and display one or more files whose names are provided as command 
line parameters. The files are displayed in the same order that they appear on the command line.
Create a Python program that performs this task. It should generate an appropriate error message
for any file that cannot be displayed, and then proceed to the next file. Display an appropriate
error message if your program is started without any command line parameters

“Alice's Adventures in Wonderland”:

Alice was
beginning to get very tired of sitting by her
sister
on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once
or twice she had peeped into the book her sister
was reading, but it had
no
pictures or conversations in it,"and what is
the use of a book," thought Alice, "without
pictures or conversations?"

When formatted for a line length of 50 characters, it should be displayed as:

Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting
by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing
to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book
her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
conversations in it, "and what is the use of a
book," thought Alice, "without pictures or
conversations?"

Ensure that your program works correctly for files containing multiple paragraphs
of text. You can detect the end of one paragraph and the beginning of the next by
looking for lines that are empty once the end of line marker has been removed. You
may perform error checking if you want to, but it is not required for this exercise.
