"""Write a Python program to calculate the area of a parallelogram : Note : A parallelogram is 
a quadrilateral with opposite sides parallel (and therefore opposite angles equal). A quadrilateral 
with equal sides is called a rhombus, and a parallelogram whose angles are all right angles is called a rectangle.
