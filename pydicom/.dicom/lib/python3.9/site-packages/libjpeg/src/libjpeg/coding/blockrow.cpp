/*************************************************************************

    This project implements a complete(!) JPEG (Recommendation ITU-T
    T.81 | ISO/IEC 10918-1) codec, plus a library that can be used to
    encode and decode JPEG streams. 
    It also implements ISO/IEC 18477 aka JPEG XT which is an extension
    towards intermediate, high-dynamic-range lossy and lossless coding
    of JPEG. In specific, it supports ISO/IEC 18477-3/-6/-7/-8 encoding.

    Note that only Profiles C and D of ISO/IEC 18477-7 are supported
    here. Check the JPEG XT reference software for a full implementation
    of ISO/IEC 18477-7.
