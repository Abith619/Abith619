Web Viewer plugin for Orthanc
=============================


General Information
-------------------

This repository contains the source code of a plugin implementing a
Web viewer for Orthanc, the lightweight, RESTful DICOM server.


Dependencies
------------

The Web viewer is based upon the Cornerstone project, a client-side
JavaScript library to display medical images in Web browsers, by Chris
Hafey <chafey@gmail.com>:
https://github.com/chafey/cornerstone

In releases < 2.6, this plugin was also implementing primitives to
decode DICOM images using GDCM in Orthanc. Starting with release 2.6,
these primitives are available as part of the "orthanc-gdcm" plugin:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/gdcm/


Installation and usage
