      <section ref="C.7.6.1.1.5" name="">The Attribute Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) conveys that the Image has undergone lossy compression. It provides a means to record that the Image has been compressed (at a point in its lifetime) with a lossy algorithm and changes have been introduced into the pixel data. Once the value has been set to “01”, it shall not be reset.
Note:  If an image is compressed with a lossy algorithm, the attribute Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) is set to “01”. Subsequently, if the image is decompressed and transferred in uncompressed format, this attribute value remains “01”.

The value of the Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) Attribute in SOP Instances containing multiple frames in which one or more of the frames have undergone lossy compression shall be “01”.
Note:  It is recommended that the applicable frames be noted in the Attribute Derivation Description (0008,2111).

If an image is originally obtained as a lossy compressed image from the sensor, then Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) is set to “01” and Value 1 of the Attribute Image Type (0008,0008) shall be set to ORIGINAL.
If an image is a compressed version of another image, Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) is set to “01”, Value 1 of the Attribute Image Type (0008,0008) shall be set to DERIVED, and if the predecessor was a DICOM image, then the Image shall receive a new SOP Instance UID.
Note:  1. It is recommended that the approximate compression ratio be provided in the Attribute Derivation Description (0008,2111). Furthermore, it is recommended that Derivation Description (0008,2111) be used to indicate when pixel data changes might affect professional interpretation. (see C.7.6.1.1.3).
  2. The attribute Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) is defined as Type 3 for backward compatibility with existing IODs. It is expected to be required (i.e., defined as Type 1C) for new Image IODs and for existing IODs that undergo a major revision (e.g. a new IOD is specified).
The Defined Terms for Lossy Image Compression Method (0028,2114) are:
ISO_10918_1 = JPEG Lossy Compression
ISO_14495_1 = JPEG-LS Near-lossless Compression

Note:   Specimen Accession Number (0040,050A) identifies tissue or fluid obtained from a Patient in a Specimen-harvest procedure. This Attribute was created to differentiate Accession Numbers, as used in Anatomic Pathology to identify specimens, from other uses of the term “Accession Number” in Information Systems. The Specimen Accession Number (0040,050A) is typically unique within the scope of the institution in which the Accession is performed. An Accession may contain multiple Specimens. Typically, an Accession contains the Specimens obtained in one Specimen-harvest procedure and submitted by one Requesting Physician. However, multiple Specimen-harvest procedures may be involved.

Note:   The Specimen Identifier (0040,0551) is typically unique within the scope of the institution in which the related Accession is performed. However, a value of Specimen Identifier (0040,0551) does not always exist. For example, it is common practice in some Anatomic Pathology departments to use a Specimen Identifier (0040,0551) to identify specimen-containers or blocks only if multiple containers or blocks are submitted for a single Accession. Therefore, Specimen Identifier (0040,0551) is modeled as a Type 2 Attribute.

Notes:  1. Previous versions of this Standard defined a Data Element "Location", which has been retired. Frame of Reference UID provides a completely unambiguous identification of the image location reference used to indicate position.
  2. A common Frame of Reference UID may be used to spatially relate localizer images with a set of transverse images. However, in some cases (eg. multiple localizer images being related to a single set of transverse images) a common Frame of Reference UID may not be sufficient. The Referenced Image Sequence (0008,1140) provides an unambiguous method for relating localizer images.

All SOP Instances that share the same Synchronization Frame of Reference UID shall be temporally related to each other.

The UTC Synchronization UID, 1.2.840.10008.15.1.1, may be used when the equipment is synchronized to the international standard UTC. In this case the quality of synchronization may be determined by means of the Time Distribution Protocol (0018,1802) and NTP Source Address (0018,1803).
Notes:  1. The Synchronization Frame of Reference UID defines an equipment synchronization environment, and does not need to be changed for each unrelated acquisition. SOP Instances may therefore share a Synchronization Frame of Reference UID, but be clinically unrelated (e.g., apply to different patients).
  2. When a synchronization environment is recalibrated, a new UID must be issued.
  3. The method of distributing the Synchronization Frame of Reference UID to multiple devices is not specified.

      <section ref="C.7.4.2.1.4" name="">The Acquisition Time Synchronized (0018,1800) attribute specifies whether the Acquisition DateTime (0008,002A) attribute of the Waveform Identification Module or the General Image Module represents an accurate synchronized timestamp for the acquisition of the waveform and/or image data. For triggered multi-frame images, the Acquisition DateTime applies to the trigger for the first image frame (see attribute Image Trigger Delay (0018.1067) in the Cine Module).
Note:   The degree of precision of the Acquisition DateTime and its accuracy relative to the external clock are not specified, but need to be appropriate for the clinical application.

For IODs that include the SR Document Content Module, the Acquisition Time Synchronized (0018,1800) attribute specifies whether the Observation DateTime (0040,A032) attribute of Items in the Content Sequence (0040,A730) of the SR Document Content Module represents an accurate synchronized timestamp for the Item.

      <description>Single pixel value or one limit (inclusive) of a range of pixel values used in animage to pad to rectangular format or to signal background that may be suppressed. See C.7.5.1.1.2 for further explanation.
Required if Pixel Padding Range Limit (0028,0121) is present. May be present otherwise.
Note: The Value Representation of this Attribute is determined by the value of Pixel Representation (0028,0103).</description>
      <section ref="C.7.5.1.1.2" name="">Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) is used to pad grayscale images (those with a Photometric Interpretation of MONOCHROME1 or MONOCHROME2)to rectangular format. The native format of some images is not rectangular. It is common for devices with this format to pad the images to the rectangular format required by the DICOM Standard with a specific pixel value that is not contained in the native image. Further, when resampling, such as after spatial registration, padding may need to be used to fill previously non-existent pixels.
Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) and Pixel Padding Range Limit (0028,0121) are also used to identify pixels to be excluded from the normal grayscale rendering pipeline for other reasons, such as suppression of background air. Pixel Padding Range Limit (0028,0121) is defined in the Image Pixel Module.
Notes:  1. The “native image” is that which is being padded to the required rectangular format, e.g., the area within the circular reconstruction perimeter of a CT image, or the subset of the rectangular area that contains useful image information.
  2. The pixel padding value is explicitly described in order to prevent display applications from taking it into account when determining the dynamic range of an image, since the Pixel Padding Value will be outside the range between the minimum and maximum values of the pixels in the native image
  3. No pixels in the native image will have a value equal to Pixel Padding Value.

Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) specifies either a single value of this padding value, or when combined with Pixel Padding Range Limit (0028,0121), a range of values (inclusive) that are padding.
The values of Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) and Pixel Padding Range Limit (0028,0121) shall be valid values within the constraints defined by Bits Allocated (0028,0100), Bits Stored (0028,0101), and High Bit (0028,0102).
Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) and Pixel Padding Range Limit (0028,0121) shall not be present when padding is performed but the pixel value used for padding does occur in the native image.
If Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) is MONOCHROME2, Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) shall be less than (closer to or equal to the minimum possible pixel value) or equal to Pixel Padding Range Limit (0028,0121). If Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) is MONOCHROME1, Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) shall be greater than (closer to or equal to the maximum possible pixel value) or equal to Pixel Padding Range Limit (0028,0121).
Notes:  1. When the relationship between pixel value and X-Ray Intensity is unknown, it is recommended that the following values be used to pad with black when the image is unsigned:
  0 if Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) is MONOCHROME2.
  2BitsStored - 1 if Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) is MONOCHROME1.
  and when the image is signed:
    -2BitsStored-1 if Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) is MONOCHROME2.
  2BitsStored-1 - 1 if Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) is MONOCHROME1.
  2. For projection radiography, when the relationship between pixel value and X-Ray Intensity is known (for example as defined by Pixel Intensity Relationship (0028,1040) and Pixel Intensity relationship Sign (0028,1041)), it is recommended that a pixel value equivalent to, or rendered similarly to, air (least X-Ray absorbance) be used for padding. However, if such a value may occur in the native image, the Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) Attribute itself should not be sent.
  E.g., for an XRF image obtained with an image intensifier, if air is black then a padded perimeter, if any, should also appear black. Typically though, if unpadded, this area would be collimated with a circular collimator, in which case the pixels would appear natively as white (greatest X-Ray absorbance) and a circular shutter would be necessary to neutralize them as black. Whether collimated areas are detected and treated as padded, or neutralized with shutters is at the discretion of the application. See also the Display Shutter Module C.7.6.11.
  3. The conditional requirement for the Pixel Padding Value Range Limit (0028,0121) in the Image Pixel Module means that it shall not be present unless Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) is also present.
  4. The range of values to be suppressed between Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) and Pixel Padding Value Range Limit (0028,0121) is specified as being inclusive, that is the values themselves as well as all values between are suppressed.
  5. When Pixel Padding Value Range Limit (0028,0121) is present, but not supported by a rendering application, the constraint that Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) is closest to the “blackest” value, which is typically the most frequently occurring background pixel, will most often result in an acceptable display, permitting “backward compatibility” in the majority of cases.

When modifying equipment changes the pixel padding value in the image, it shall change the values of Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) and Pixel Padding Range Limit (0028,0121), if present. If modifying equipment changes the pixel padding values in the image to values present in the native image, the attribute Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) and Pixel Padding Range Limit (0028,0121) shall be removed.
Notes:  1. For example, if a CT image containing signed values from -1024 to 3191 and a Pixel Padding Value of -2000 and a Rescale Intercept of 0 is converted to an unsigned image with a Rescale Intercept of -1024 by adding 1024 to all pixels and clipping all more negative pixels to 0, then the padding pixels will be indistinguishable from some of the modified native image pixels, and hence Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) needs to be removed.
  2. If the modification involves lossy compression, which may result in changes to the pixel values, then the application of Pixel Padding Value and Pixel Padding Range Limit may result in a different appearance, and hence these attributes may need different values also.

REORIENTED_ONLY - A projection radiograph that has been flipped, and/or rotated by a multiple of 90 degrees

Notes: 1. This applies not only to images with a known relationship to a 3D space, but also to projection images. For example, a projection radiograph such as a mammogram that is processed by a point image processing operation such as contrast enhancement, or a smoothing or edge enhancing convolution, would have a value of YES for this attribute. A projection radiograph that had been magnified or warped geometrically would have a value of NO for this attribute. A projection radiograph that has been flipped, and/or rotated by a multiple of 90 degrees, such that transformation of pixel locations is possible by comparison of the values of Patient Orientation (0020,0020) would have a value of REORIENTED_ONLY. This attribute is typically of importance in relating images with Presentation Intent Type (0008,0068) values of FOR PROCESSING and FOR PRESENTATION.
2. When the value of this attribute is NO, it is not possible to locate on the current image any pixel coordinates that are referenced relative to the source image, such as for example, might be required for rendering CAD findings derived from a referenced FOR PROCESSING image on the current FOR PRESENTATION image.</description>

Required if pixel padding is to be defined as a range rather than a single value.
Notes: 1. The Value Representation of this Attribute is determined by the value of Pixel Representation (0028,0103).
2. Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) is also required when this Attribute is present.</description>
      <section ref="C.7.5.1.1.2" name="">Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) is used to pad grayscale images (those with a Photometric Interpretation of MONOCHROME1 or MONOCHROME2)to rectangular format. The native format of some images is not rectangular. It is common for devices with this format to pad the images to the rectangular format required by the DICOM Standard with a specific pixel value that is not contained in the native image. Further, when resampling, such as after spatial registration, padding may need to be used to fill previously non-existent pixels.
Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) and Pixel Padding Range Limit (0028,0121) are also used to identify pixels to be excluded from the normal grayscale rendering pipeline for other reasons, such as suppression of background air. Pixel Padding Range Limit (0028,0121) is defined in the Image Pixel Module.
Notes:  1. The “native image” is that which is being padded to the required rectangular format, e.g., the area within the circular reconstruction perimeter of a CT image, or the subset of the rectangular area that contains useful image information.
  2. The pixel padding value is explicitly described in order to prevent display applications from taking it into account when determining the dynamic range of an image, since the Pixel Padding Value will be outside the range between the minimum and maximum values of the pixels in the native image
  3. No pixels in the native image will have a value equal to Pixel Padding Value.

Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) specifies either a single value of this padding value, or when combined with Pixel Padding Range Limit (0028,0121), a range of values (inclusive) that are padding.
The values of Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) and Pixel Padding Range Limit (0028,0121) shall be valid values within the constraints defined by Bits Allocated (0028,0100), Bits Stored (0028,0101), and High Bit (0028,0102).
Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) and Pixel Padding Range Limit (0028,0121) shall not be present when padding is performed but the pixel value used for padding does occur in the native image.
If Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) is MONOCHROME2, Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) shall be less than (closer to or equal to the minimum possible pixel value) or equal to Pixel Padding Range Limit (0028,0121). If Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) is MONOCHROME1, Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) shall be greater than (closer to or equal to the maximum possible pixel value) or equal to Pixel Padding Range Limit (0028,0121).
Notes:  1. When the relationship between pixel value and X-Ray Intensity is unknown, it is recommended that the following values be used to pad with black when the image is unsigned:
  0 if Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) is MONOCHROME2.
  2BitsStored - 1 if Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) is MONOCHROME1.
  and when the image is signed:
    -2BitsStored-1 if Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) is MONOCHROME2.
  2BitsStored-1 - 1 if Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) is MONOCHROME1.
  2. For projection radiography, when the relationship between pixel value and X-Ray Intensity is known (for example as defined by Pixel Intensity Relationship (0028,1040) and Pixel Intensity relationship Sign (0028,1041)), it is recommended that a pixel value equivalent to, or rendered similarly to, air (least X-Ray absorbance) be used for padding. However, if such a value may occur in the native image, the Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) Attribute itself should not be sent.
  E.g., for an XRF image obtained with an image intensifier, if air is black then a padded perimeter, if any, should also appear black. Typically though, if unpadded, this area would be collimated with a circular collimator, in which case the pixels would appear natively as white (greatest X-Ray absorbance) and a circular shutter would be necessary to neutralize them as black. Whether collimated areas are detected and treated as padded, or neutralized with shutters is at the discretion of the application. See also the Display Shutter Module C.7.6.11.
  3. The conditional requirement for the Pixel Padding Value Range Limit (0028,0121) in the Image Pixel Module means that it shall not be present unless Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) is also present.
  4. The range of values to be suppressed between Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) and Pixel Padding Value Range Limit (0028,0121) is specified as being inclusive, that is the values themselves as well as all values between are suppressed.
  5. When Pixel Padding Value Range Limit (0028,0121) is present, but not supported by a rendering application, the constraint that Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) is closest to the “blackest” value, which is typically the most frequently occurring background pixel, will most often result in an acceptable display, permitting “backward compatibility” in the majority of cases.

When modifying equipment changes the pixel padding value in the image, it shall change the values of Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) and Pixel Padding Range Limit (0028,0121), if present. If modifying equipment changes the pixel padding values in the image to values present in the native image, the attribute Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) and Pixel Padding Range Limit (0028,0121) shall be removed.
Notes:  1. For example, if a CT image containing signed values from -1024 to 3191 and a Pixel Padding Value of -2000 and a Rescale Intercept of 0 is converted to an unsigned image with a Rescale Intercept of -1024 by adding 1024 to all pixels and clipping all more negative pixels to 0, then the padding pixels will be indistinguishable from some of the modified native image pixels, and hence Pixel Padding Value (0028,0120) needs to be removed.
  2. If the modification involves lossy compression, which may result in changes to the pixel values, then the application of Pixel Padding Value and Pixel Padding Range Limit may result in a different appearance, and hence these attributes may need different values also.

      <description>Number of samples (planes) in this image. See C.7.6.3.1.1 for further explanation.</description>
      <section ref="C.7.6.3.1.1" name="">Samples per Pixel (0028,0002) is the number of separate planes in this image. One, three, and four image planes are defined. Other numbers of image planes are allowed, but their meaning is not defined by this Standard.
For monochrome (gray scale) and palette color images, the number of planes is 1. For RGB and other three vector color models, the value of this attribute is 3. For four vector color models, the value of this attribute is 4.
All image planes shall have the same number of Rows (0028,0010), Columns (0028,0011), Bits Allocated (0028,0100), Bits Stored (0028,0101), High Bit (0028,0102), Pixel Representation (0028,0103), and Pixel Aspect Ratio (0028,0034).
The data in each pixel may be represented as a “Composite Pixel Code”. If Samples Per Pixel is one, the Composite Pixel Code is just the “n” bit pixel sample, where “n” = Bits Allocated. If Samples Per Pixel is greater than one, Composite Pixel Code is a “k” bit concatenation of samples, where “k” = Bits Allocated multiplied by Samples Per Pixel, and with the sample representing the vector color designated first in the Photometric Interpretation name comprising the most significant bits of the Composite Pixel Code, followed in order by the samples representing the next vector colors, with the sample representing the vector color designated last in the Photometric Interpretation name comprising the least significant bits of the Composite Pixel Code. For example, for Photometric Interpretation = “RGB”, the most significant “Bits Allocated” bits contain the Red sample, the next “Bits Allocated” bits contain the Green sample, and the least significant “Bits Allocated” bits contain the Blue sample.

      <description>Specifies the intended interpretation of the pixel data. See C.7.6.3.1.2 for further explanation.</description>
      <section ref="C.7.6.3.1.2" name="">The value of Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) specifies the intended interpretation of the image pixel data.
See PS 3.5 for restrictions imposed by compressed Transfer Syntaxes.
The following values are defined. Other values are permitted but the meaning is not defined by this Standard.
MONOCHROME1 = Pixel data represent a single monochrome image plane. The minimum sample value is intended to be displayed as white after any VOI gray scale transformations have been performed. See PS 3.4. This value may be used only when Samples per Pixel (0028,0002) has a value of 1.
MONOCHROME2 = Pixel data represent a single monochrome image plane. The minimum sample value is intended to be displayed as black after any VOI gray scale transformations have been performed. See PS 3.4. This value may be used only when Samples per Pixel (0028,0002) has a value of 1.
PALETTE COLOR = Pixel data describe a color image with a single sample per pixel (single image plane). The pixel value is used as an index into each of the Red, Blue, and Green Palette Color Lookup Tables (0028,1101-1103&amp;1201-1203). This value may be used only when Samples per Pixel (0028,0002) has a value of 1. When the Photometric Interpretation is Palette Color; Red, Blue, and Green Palette Color Lookup Tables shall be present.
RGB = Pixel data represent a color image described by red, green, and blue image planes. The minimum sample value for each color plane represents minimum intensity of the color. This value may be used only when Samples per Pixel (0028,0002) has a value of 3.
HSV = Retired.
ARGB = Retired.
CMYK = Retired.
YBR_FULL = Pixel data represent a color image described by one luminance (Y) and two chrominance planes (CB and CR). This photometric interpretation may be used only when Samples per Pixel (0028,0002) has a value of 3. Black is represented by Y equal to zero. The absence of color is represented by both CB and CR values equal to half full scale.
Note:  In the case where the Bits Allocated (0028,0100) has value of 8 half full scale is 128.

In the case where Bits Allocated (0028,0100) has a value of 8 then the following equations convert between RGB and YCBCR Photometric Interpretation.
Y =  +  .2990R  +  .5870G  +  .1140B
CB =  -  .1687R  -  .3313G  +  .5000B  +  128
CR =  +  .5000R  -  .4187G  -  .0813B  +  128
Note:  The above is based on CCIR Recommendation 601-2 dated 1990.

YBR_FULL_422 = The same as YBR_FULL except that the CB and CR values are sampled horizontally at half the Y rate and as a result there are half as many CB and CR values as Y values.
This Photometric Interpretation is only allowed with Planar Configuration (0028,0006) equal to 0. Two Y values shall be stored followed by one CB and one CR value. The CB and CR values shall be sampled at the location of the first of the two Y values. For each Row of Pixels, the first CB and CR samples shall be at the location of the first Y sample. The next CB and CR samples shall be at the location of the third Y sample etc.
Note:  This subsampling is often referred to as cosited sampling.

YBR_PARTIAL_422 = The same as YBR_FULL_422 except that:
1. black corresponds to Y = 16;
2. Y is restricted to 220 levels (i.e. the maximum value is 235);
3. CB and CR each has a minimum value of 16;
4. CB and CR are restricted to 225 levels (i.e. the maximum value is 240);
5. lack of color is represented by CB and CR equal to 128.
In the case where Bits Allocated (0028,0100) has value of 8 then the following equations convert between RGB and YBR_PARTIAL_422 Photometric Interpretation
Y =  +  .2568R  +  .5041G  +  .0979B  +  16
CB =  -  .1482R  -  .2910G  +  .4392B  +  128
CR =  +  .4392R  -  .3678G  -  .0714B  +  128
Note:  The above is based on CCIR Recommendation 601-2 dated 1990.

YBR_PARTIAL_420 = The same as YBR_PARTIAL_422 except that the CB and CR values are sampled horizontally and vertically at half the Y rate and as a result there are four times less CB and CR values than Y values, versus twice less for YBR_PARTIAL_422.
This Photometric Interpretation is only allowed with Planar Configuration (0028,0006) equal to 0. The CB and CR values shall be sampled at the location of the first of the two Y values. For the first Row of Pixels (etc.), the first CB and CR samples shall be at the location of the first Y sample. The next CB and CR samples shall be at the location of the third Y sample etc. The next Rows of Pixels containing CB and CR samples (at the same locations than for the first Row) will be the third etc.
YBR_ICT = Irreversible Color Transformation:
Pixel data represent a color image described by one luminance (Y) and two chrominance planes (CB and CR). This photometric interpretation may be used only when Samples per Pixel (0028,0002) has a value of 3. Black is represented by Y equal to zero. The absence of color is represented by both CB and CR values equal to zero.
Regardless of the value of Bits Allocated (0028,0100), the following equations convert between RGB and YCBCR Photometric Interpretation.
Y =  +  .29900R  +  .58700G  +  .11400B
CB =  -  .16875R  -  .33126G  +  .50000B
CR =  +  .50000R  -  .41869G  -  .08131B
Notes:  1. The above is based on ISO/IEC 15444-1 (JPEG 2000).
  2. In a JPEG 2000 bitstream, DC level shifting (used if the untransformed components are unsigned) is applied before forward color transformation, and the transformed components may be signed (unlike in JPEG ISO/IEC 10918-1).
  3. In JPEG 2000, spatial down-sampling of the chrominance components, if performed, is signaled in the JPEG 2000 bitstream.

YBR_RCT = Reversible Color Transformation:
Pixel data represent a color image described by one luminance (Y) and two chrominance planes (CB and CR). This photometric interpretation may be used only when Samples per Pixel (0028,0002) has a value of 3. Black is represented by Y equal to zero. The absence of color is represented by both CB and CR values equal to zero.
Regardless of the value of Bits Allocated (0028,0100), the following equations convert between RGB and YBR_RCT Photometric Interpretation.
Y = R + 2G +B) / 4        (Note:  mean floor)
CB = B - G
CR = R - G
The following equations convert between YBR_RCT and RGB Photometric Interpretation.
G = Y –  (CR + CB) / 4
R = CR + G
B = CB + G
Notes:  1. The above is based on ISO/IEC 15444-1 (JPEG 2000).
  2. In a JPEG 2000 bitstream, DC level shifting (used if the untransformed components are unsigned) is applied before forward color transformation, and the transformed components may be signed (unlike in JPEG ISO/IEC 10918-1).
  3. This photometric interpretation is a reversible approximation to the YUV transformation used in PAL and SECAM.

Enumerated Values:

      <section ref="C.7.6.3.1.5" name="">The three values of Palette Color Lookup Table Descriptor (0028,1101-1103) describe the format of the Lookup Table Data in the corresponding Data Element (0028,1201-1203) or (0028,1221-1223).
The first value is the number of entries in the lookup table. When the number of table entries is equal to 216 then this value shall be 0. The first value shall be identical for each of the Red, Green and Blue Palette Color Lookup Table Descriptors.
The second value is the first stored pixel value mapped. This pixel value is mapped to the first entry in the Lookup Table Data. All image pixel values less than the first value mapped are also mapped to the first entry in the Lookup Table Data if the Photometric Interpretation is PALETTE COLOR.
Note:  In the case of the Supplemental Palette Color LUT, the stored pixel values less than the second descriptor value are grayscale values.

An image pixel value one greater than the first value mapped is mapped to the second entry in the Lookup Table Data. Subsequent image pixel values are mapped to the subsequent entries in the Lookup Table Data up to an image pixel value equal to number of entries + first value mapped – 1, which is mapped to the last entry in the Lookup Table Data. Image pixel values greater than or equal to number of entries + first value mapped are also mapped to the last entry in the Lookup Table Data. The second value shall be identical for each of the Red, Green and Blue Palette Color Lookup Table Descriptors.
The third value specifies the number of bits for each entry in the Lookup Table Data. It shall take the value of 8 or 16. The LUT Data shall be stored in a format equivalent to 8 bits allocated when the number of bits for each entry is 8, and 16 bits allocated when the number of bits for each entry is 16, where in both cases the high bit is equal to bits allocated-1. The third value shall be identical for each of the Red, Green and Blue Palette Color Lookup Table Descriptors.
Note:  Some implementations have encoded 8 bit entries with 16 bits allocated, padding the high bits; this can be detected by comparing the number of entries specified in the LUT Descriptor with the actual value length of the LUT Data entry. The value length in bytes should equal the number of entries if bits allocated is 8, and be twice as long if bits allocated is 16.

When the Palette Color Lookup Table Descriptor (0028,1101-1103) are used as part of the Palette Color Lookup Table Module or the Supplemental Palette Color Lookup Table Module, the third value shall be equal to 16.
Notes:  1. A value of 16 indicates the Lookup Table Data will range from (0,0,0) minimum intensity to (65535,65535,65535) maximum intensity.
  2. Since the Palette Color Lookup Table Descriptor (0028,1101-1103) Attributes are multi-valued, in an Explicit VR Transfer Syntax, only one value representation (US or SS) may be specified, even though the first and third values are always by definition interpreted as unsigned. The explicit VR actually used is dictated by the VR needed to represent the second value, which will be consistent with Pixel Representation (0028,0103).

Palette color values must always be scaled across the full range of available intensities. This is indicated by the fact that there are no bits stored and high bit values for palette color data.
Note:  For example, if there are 16 bits per entry specified and only 8 bits of value are truly used then the 8 bit intensities from 0 to 255 must be scaled to the corresponding 16 bit intensities from 0 to 65535. To do this for 8 bit values, simply replicate the value in both the most and least significant bytes.

These lookup tables shall be used only when there is a single sample per pixel (single image plane) in the image.
These lookup tables are required when the value of Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) is Palette Color. The semantics of these lookup tables is not defined otherwise.

Palette color values must always be scaled across the full range of available intensities. This is indicated by the fact that there are no bits stored and high bit values for palette color data.
Note:  For example, if there are 16 bits per entry specified and only 8 bits of value are truly used then the 8 bit intensities from 0 to 255 must be scaled to the corresponding 16 bit intensities from 0 to 65535. To do this for 8 bit values, simply replicate the value in both the most and least significant bytes.

These lookup tables shall be used only when there is a single sample per pixel (single image plane) in the image.
These lookup tables are required when the value of Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) is Palette Color. The semantics of these lookup tables is not defined otherwise.

      <section ref="C.7.6.16.2.14.1" name="">Subtraction Item ID (0028,9416) specifies the ID of a subtraction operation to which the Mask Sub-pixel Shift (0028,6114) is associated. The Subtraction Item ID is also present in the Mask Subtraction Sequence (0028,6100) to allow this association.
When used as per-frame macro, the Subtraction Item ID (0028,9416) allows to specify different values of Mask Sub-pixel Shift (0028,6114) individually frame by frame, and relate them to a single item of the Mask Subtraction Sequence (0028,6100).
Note:  There is no restriction in the number of Subtraction Item ID’s associated to each contrast frame. The same contrast frame may be present in several items of the Mask Subtraction Sequence, each item having a different value of Subtraction Item ID.

When used as shared macro, the Subtraction Item ID (0028,9416) allows to specify one or more values of Mask Sub-pixel Shift that will be applied to all the frames of the Multi-frame image.
Note:  Example of usage of Subtraction Item ID in a per-frame macro, see Figure C.7.6.16-8:
  In this example of Multi-Frame Image with 3 frames, one Mask Frame (i.e., Frame 1) is applied to the next two frames of the Multi-Frame image (i.e., Frames 2 and 3). Therefore, there is only one item in the Mask Subtraction Sequence, containing its own Subtraction Item ID value (i.e., 100). The Frame Pixel Shift Macro allows to define a Mask Sub-Pixel Shift different for each contrast frame.
  First Frame Subtracted: Subtraction of Frame 1 (Mask) to Frame 2, with Sub-Pixel Shift 1.3\2.4
  Second Frame Subtracted: Subtraction of Frame 1 (Mask) to Frame 3, with Sub-Pixel Shift 1.9\3.0

The direction of the axes is defined fully by the patient’s orientation. The x-axis is increasing to the left hand side of the patient. The y-axis is increasing to the posterior side of the patient. The z-axis is increasing toward the head of the patient.
The patient based coordinate system is a right handed system, i.e. the vector cross product of a unit vector along the positive x-axis and a unit vector along the positive y-axis is equal to a unit vector along the positive z-axis.
Note  If a patient lies parallel to the ground, face-up on the table, with his feet-to-head direction same as the front-to-back direction of the imaging equipment, the direction of the axes of this patient based coordinate system and the equipment based coordinate system in previous versions of this Standard will coincide.

The Image Plane Attributes, in conjunction with the Pixel Spacing Attribute, describe the position and orientation of the image slices relative to the patient-based coordinate system. In each image frame the Image Position (Patient) (0020,0032) specifies the origin of the image with respect to the patient-based coordinate system. RCS and the Image Orientation (Patient) (0020,0037) attribute values specify the orientation of the image frame rows and columns. The mapping of pixel location  to the RCS is calculated as follows:

They may be used whether or not the Source Image Sequence (0008,2112) is provided. They may also be used in cases when the Derived Image pixel data is not significantly changed from one of the source images and the SOP Instance UID of the Derived Image is the same as the one used for the source image.
Notes:  1. Examples of Derived Images that would normally be expected to affect professional interpretation and would thus have a new UID include:
  a.  images resulting from image processing of another image (e.g. unsharp masking),
  b.  a multiplanar reformatted CT image,
  c.  a DSA image derived by subtracting pixel values of one image from another.
d.  an image that has been decompressed after having been compressed with a lossy compression algorithm. To ensure that the user has the necessary information about the lossy compression, the approximate compression ratio may be included in Derivation Description (0008,2111).
  An example of a Derived Image that would normally not be expected to affect professional interpretation and thus would not require a new UID is an image that has been padded with additional rows and columns for more display purposes.
  2. An image may be lossy compressed, e.g., for long term archive purposes, and its SOP Instance UID changed. PS3.4 provides a mechanism by which a query for the original image Instance may return a reference to the UID of the lossy compressed version of the image using the Alternate Representation Sequence (0008,3001). This allows an application processing a SOP Instance that references the original image UID, e.g., a Structured Report, to obtain a reference to an accessible version of the image even if the original SOP Instance is no longer available.

Notes:  1. Examples of Derived Images that would normally be expected to affect professional interpretation and would thus have a new UID include:
  a.  images resulting from image processing of another image (e.g. unsharp masking),
  b.  a multiplanar reformatted CT image,
  c.  a DSA image derived by subtracting pixel values of one image from another.
d.  an image that has been decompressed after having been compressed with a lossy compression algorithm. To ensure that the user has the necessary information about the lossy compression, the approximate compression ratio may be included in Derivation Description (0008,2111).
  An example of a Derived Image that would normally not be expected to affect professional interpretation and thus would not require a new UID is an image that has been padded with additional rows and columns for more display purposes.

      <description>Window Center for display. See C.11.2.1.2 for further explanation.</description>
      <section ref="C.11.2.1.2" name="">Window Center (0028,1050) and Window Width (0028,1051) specify a linear conversion from stored pixel values (after any Modality LUT or Rescale Slope and Intercept specified in the IOD have been applied) to values to be displayed. Window Center contains the input value that is the center of the window. Window Width contains the width of the window.
Note:  The terms “window center” and “window width” are not consistently used in practice, nor were they defined in previous versions of the standard. The definitions here are presented for the purpose of defining consistent meanings for identity and threshold transformations while preserving the common practice of using integral values for center and width.

Window Width (0028,1051) shall always be greater than or equal to 1.
When Window Width (0028,1051) is greater than 1, these Attributes select the range of input values that are to be mapped to the full range of the displayed output.
When Window Width (0028,1051) is equal to 1, they specify a threshold below which input values will be displayed as the minimum output value.
Note:  Whether the minimum output value is rendered as black or white may depend on the value of Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) or the presence of a Presentation LUT Module.

These Attributes are applied according to the following pseudo-code, where x is the input value, y is an output value with a range from ymin to ymax, c is Window Center (0028,1050) and w is Window Width (0028,1051):
    if  (x &lt;= c - 0.5 - (w-1)/2), then y = ymin
    else if  (x &gt; c - 0.5 + (w-1)/2), then y = ymax,
    else  y = ((x - (c - 0.5)) / (w-1) + 0.5) * (ymax - ymin)+ ymin

Notes:  1. For the purpose of this definition, a floating point calculation without integer truncation is assumed, though the manner of implementation may vary as long as the result is the same.
  2. The pseudo-code function computes a continuous value over the output range without any discontinuity at the boundaries. The value of 0 for w is expressly forbidden, and the value of 1 for w does not cause division by zero, since the continuous segment of the function will never be reached for that case.
  3. For example, for an output range 0 to 255:
    c=2048, w=4096 becomes:
      if (x &lt;= 0) then y = 0
      else if (x &gt; 4095) then y = 255
      else y = ((x - 2047.5) / 4095 + 0.5) * (255-0) + 0
    c=2048, w=1 becomes:
      if (x &lt;= 2047.5) then y = 0
      else if (x &gt; 2047.5) then y = 255
      else /* not reached */

    c=0, w=100 becomes:
      if (x &lt;= -50) then y = 0
      else if (x &gt; 49) then y = 255
      else y = ((x + 0.5) / 99 + 0.5) * (255-0) + 0
    c=0, w=1 becomes:
      if (x &lt;= -0.5) then y = 0
      else if (x &gt; -0.5) then y = 255
      else /* not reached */

  4. A Window Center of 2n-1 and a Window Width of 2n selects the range of input values from 0 to 2n-1. This represents an identity VOI LUT transformation in the case where no Modality LUT is specified and the stored pixel data are n bit unsigned integers.
  5. A Window Width of 1 is typically used to represent a "threshold" operation in which those integer input values less than the Window Center are represented as the minimum displayed value and those greater than or equal to the Window Center are represented as the maximum displayed value. A Window Width of 2 will have the same result for integral input values.
  6. The application of Window Center (0028,1050) and Window Width (0028,1051) may select a signed input range. There is no implication that this signed input range is clipped to zero.
  7. The selected input range may exceed the actual range of the input values, thus effectively “compressing” the contrast range of the displayed data into a narrower band of the available contrast range, and “flattening” the appearance. There are no limits to the maximum value of the window width, or to the minimum or maximum value of window level, both of which may exceed the actual or possible range of input values.
  8. Input values "below" the window are displayed as the minimum output value and input values "above" the window are displayed as the maximum output value. This is the common usage of the window operation in medical imaging. There is no provision for an alternative approach in which all values "outside" the window are displayed as the minimum output value.
  9. The output of the Window Center/Width or VOI LUT transformation is either implicitly scaled to the full range of the display device if there is no succeeding transformation defined, or implicitly scaled to the full input range of the succeeding transformation step (such as the Presentation LUT), if present. See C.11.6.1.
  10. Fractional values of Window Center and Window Width are permitted (since the VR of these Attributes is Decimal String), and though they are not often encountered, applications should be prepared to accept them.

These Attributes shall be used only for Images with Photometric Interpretation (0028,0004) values of MONOCHROME1 and MONOCHROME2. They have no meaning for other Images.
If multiple values are present, both Attributes shall have the same number of values and shall be considered as pairs. Multiple values indicate that multiple alternative views may be presented.
If any VOI LUT Table is included by an Image, a Window Width and Window Center or the VOI LUT Table, but not both, may be applied to the Image for display. Inclusion of both indicates that multiple alternative views may be presented.
If multiple items are present in VOI LUT Sequence (0028,3010), only one may be applied to the Image for display. Multiple items indicate that multiple alternative views may be presented.
If the VOI LUT Module is defined in an IOD and if neither a VOI LUT Sequence nor a Window Width and Window Center are present, then the VOI LUT stage of the grayscale pipeline is defined to be an identity transformation.
Notes:  1. This requirement is specified so that IODs that define a particular output space for the grayscale pipeline, such as P-Values, are not in an undefined state when no VOI LUT Sequence or Window Width and Window Center are present.
  2. Despite the Type 3 requirement for VOI LUT Sequence and Window Center, implementations that render images are expected to implement and apply these transformations when they are present in the image, unless overridden by the user, a presentation state, or a hanging protocol, and to allow the user to select which transformation to apply when multiple transformations are present.

If multiple items are present in VOI LUT Sequence (0028,3010), only one may be applied to the Image for display. Multiple items indicate that multiple alternative views may be presented.
If the VOI LUT Module is defined in an IOD and if neither a VOI LUT Sequence nor a Window Width and Window Center are present, then the VOI LUT stage of the grayscale pipeline is defined to be an identity transformation.
Notes:  1. This requirement is specified so that IODs that define a particular output space for the grayscale pipeline, such as P-Values, are not in an undefined state when no VOI LUT Sequence or Window Width and Window Center are present.
  2. Despite the Type 3 requirement for VOI LUT Sequence and Window Center, implementations that render images are expected to implement and apply these transformations when they are present in the image, unless overridden by the user, a presentation state, or a hanging protocol, and to allow the user to select which transformation to apply when multiple transformations are present.

When used as per-frame macro, the Subtraction Item ID (0028,9416) allows to specify different values of Mask Sub-pixel Shift (0028,6114) individually frame by frame, and relate them to a single item of the Mask Subtraction Sequence (0028,6100).
Note:  There is no restriction in the number of Subtraction Item ID’s associated to each contrast frame. The same contrast frame may be present in several items of the Mask Subtraction Sequence, each item having a different value of Subtraction Item ID.

When used as shared macro, the Subtraction Item ID (0028,9416) allows to specify one or more values of Mask Sub-pixel Shift that will be applied to all the frames of the Multi-frame image.
Note:  Example of usage of Subtraction Item ID in a per-frame macro, see Figure C.7.6.16-8:
  In this example of Multi-Frame Image with 3 frames, one Mask Frame (i.e., Frame 1) is applied to the next two frames of the Multi-Frame image (i.e., Frames 2 and 3). Therefore, there is only one item in the Mask Subtraction Sequence, containing its own Subtraction Item ID value (i.e., 100). The Frame Pixel Shift Macro allows to define a Mask Sub-Pixel Shift different for each contrast frame.
  First Frame Subtracted: Subtraction of Frame 1 (Mask) to Frame 2, with Sub-Pixel Shift 1.3\2.4
  Second Frame Subtracted: Subtraction of Frame 1 (Mask) to Frame 3, with Sub-Pixel Shift 1.9\3.0

However, when frames are the result of retrospective gating, that is, the data is continuously acquired and then later compared with a simultaneously acquired respiratory waveform and fitted into bins corresponding to nominal phases of the respiratory cycle, then Nominal Respiratory Trigger Delay Time (0020,9255) and the Actual Respiratory Trigger Delay Time (0020,9257) may have different values.

      <description>Specifies the format of the Red Palette Color Lookup Table Data (0028,1201). See C.7.6.3.1.5 for further explanation.</description>
      <section ref="C.7.6.3.1.5" name="">The three values of Palette Color Lookup Table Descriptor (0028,1101-1103) describe the format of the Lookup Table Data in the corresponding Data Element (0028,1201-1203) or (0028,1221-1223).
The first value is the number of entries in the lookup table. When the number of table entries is equal to 216 then this value shall be 0. The first value shall be identical for each of the Red, Green and Blue Palette Color Lookup Table Descriptors.
The second value is the first stored pixel value mapped. This pixel value is mapped to the first entry in the Lookup Table Data. All image pixel values less than the first value mapped are also mapped to the first entry in the Lookup Table Data if the Photometric Interpretation is PALETTE COLOR.
Note:  In the case of the Supplemental Palette Color LUT, the stored pixel values less than the second descriptor value are grayscale values.

An image pixel value one greater than the first value mapped is mapped to the second entry in the Lookup Table Data. Subsequent image pixel values are mapped to the subsequent entries in the Lookup Table Data up to an image pixel value equal to number of entries + first value mapped – 1, which is mapped to the last entry in the Lookup Table Data. Image pixel values greater than or equal to number of entries + first value mapped are also mapped to the last entry in the Lookup Table Data. The second value shall be identical for each of the Red, Green and Blue Palette Color Lookup Table Descriptors.
The third value specifies the number of bits for each entry in the Lookup Table Data. It shall take the value of 8 or 16. The LUT Data shall be stored in a format equivalent to 8 bits allocated when the number of bits for each entry is 8, and 16 bits allocated when the number of bits for each entry is 16, where in both cases the high bit is equal to bits allocated-1. The third value shall be identical for each of the Red, Green and Blue Palette Color Lookup Table Descriptors.
Note:  Some implementations have encoded 8 bit entries with 16 bits allocated, padding the high bits; this can be detected by comparing the number of entries specified in the LUT Descriptor with the actual value length of the LUT Data entry. The value length in bytes should equal the number of entries if bits allocated is 8, and be twice as long if bits allocated is 16.

When the Palette Color Lookup Table Descriptor (0028,1101-1103) are used as part of the Palette Color Lookup Table Module or the Supplemental Palette Color Lookup Table Module, the third value shall be equal to 16.
Notes:  1. A value of 16 indicates the Lookup Table Data will range from (0,0,0) minimum intensity to (65535,65535,65535) maximum intensity.
  2. Since the Palette Color Lookup Table Descriptor (0028,1101-1103) Attributes are multi-valued, in an Explicit VR Transfer Syntax, only one value representation (US or SS) may be specified, even though the first and third values are always by definition interpreted as unsigned. The explicit VR actually used is dictated by the VR needed to represent the second value, which will be consistent with Pixel Representation (0028,0103).

Note:  In the case of the Supplemental Palette Color LUT, the stored pixel values less than the second descriptor value are grayscale values.

An image pixel value one greater than the first value mapped is mapped to the second entry in the Lookup Table Data. Subsequent image pixel values are mapped to the subsequent entries in the Lookup Table Data up to an image pixel value equal to number of entries + first value mapped – 1, which is mapped to the last entry in the Lookup Table Data. Image pixel values greater than or equal to number of entries + first value mapped are also mapped to the last entry in the Lookup Table Data. The second value shall be identical for each of the Red, Green and Blue Palette Color Lookup Table Descriptors.
The third value specifies the number of bits for each entry in the Lookup Table Data. It shall take the value of 8 or 16. The LUT Data shall be stored in a format equivalent to 8 bits allocated when the number of bits for each entry is 8, and 16 bits allocated when the number of bits for each entry is 16, where in both cases the high bit is equal to bits allocated-1. The third value shall be identical for each of the Red, Green and Blue Palette Color Lookup Table Descriptors.
Note:  Some implementations have encoded 8 bit entries with 16 bits allocated, padding the high bits; this can be detected by comparing the number of entries specified in the LUT Descriptor with the actual value length of the LUT Data entry. The value length in bytes should equal the number of entries if bits allocated is 8, and be twice as long if bits allocated is 16.

When the Palette Color Lookup Table Descriptor (0028,1101-1103) are used as part of the Palette Color Lookup Table Module or the Supplemental Palette Color Lookup Table Module, the third value shall be equal to 16.
Notes:  1. A value of 16 indicates the Lookup Table Data will range from (0,0,0) minimum intensity to (65535,65535,65535) maximum intensity.
  2. Since the Palette Color Lookup Table Descriptor (0028,1101-1103) Attributes are multi-valued, in an Explicit VR Transfer Syntax, only one value representation (US or SS) may be specified, even though the first and third values are always by definition interpreted as unsigned. The explicit VR actually used is dictated by the VR needed to represent the second value, which will be consistent with Pixel Representation (0028,0103).

Once the value has been set to “01”, it shall not be reset.
Note:  If an image is compressed with a lossy algorithm, the attribute Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) is set to “01”. Subsequently, if the image is decompressed and transferred in uncompressed format, this attribute value remains “01”.

The value of the Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) Attribute in SOP Instances containing multiple frames in which one or more of the frames have undergone lossy compression shall be “01”.
Note:  It is recommended that the applicable frames be noted in the Attribute Derivation Description (0008,2111).

If an image is a compressed version of another image, Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) is set to “01”, Value 1 of the Attribute Image Type (0008,0008) shall be set to DERIVED, and if the predecessor was a DICOM image, then the Image shall receive a new SOP Instance UID.
Note:  1. It is recommended that the approximate compression ratio be provided in the Attribute Derivation Description (0008,2111). Furthermore, it is recommended that Derivation Description (0008,2111) be used to indicate when pixel data changes might affect professional interpretation. (see C.7.6.1.1.3).
  2. The attribute Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) is defined as Type 3 for backward compatibility with existing IODs. It is expected to be required (i.e., defined as Type 1C) for new Image IODs and for existing IODs that undergo a major revision (e.g. a new IOD is specified).

      <section ref="C.7.6.2.1.1" name="">The Image Position (0020,0032) specifies the x, y, and z coordinates of the upper left hand corner of the image; it is the center of the first voxel transmitted. Image Orientation (0020,0037) specifies the direction cosines of the first row and the first column with respect to the patient. These Attributes shall be provide as a pair. Row value for the x, y, and z axes respectively followed by the Column value for the x, y, and z axes respectively.
The direction of the axes is defined fully by the patient’s orientation. The x-axis is increasing to the left hand side of the patient. The y-axis is increasing to the posterior side of the patient. The z-axis is increasing toward the head of the patient.
The patient based coordinate system is a right handed system, i.e. the vector cross product of a unit vector along the positive x-axis and a unit vector along the positive y-axis is equal to a unit vector along the positive z-axis.
Note  If a patient lies parallel to the ground, face-up on the table, with his feet-to-head direction same as the front-to-back direction of the imaging equipment, the direction of the axes of this patient based coordinate system and the equipment based coordinate system in previous versions of this Standard will coincide.

The Image Plane Attributes, in conjunction with the Pixel Spacing Attribute, describe the position and orientation of the image slices relative to the patient-based coordinate system. In each image frame the Image Position (Patient) (0020,0032) specifies the origin of the image with respect to the patient-based coordinate system. RCS and the Image Orientation (Patient) (0020,0037) attribute values specify the orientation of the image frame rows and columns. The mapping of pixel location  to the RCS is calculated as follows:

Sxyz  The three values of the Image Position (Patient) (0020,0032) attributes. It is the location in mm from the origin of the RCS.
Xxyz  The values from the row (X) direction cosine of the Image Orientation (Patient) (0020,0037) attribute.

      <description>The x, y, and z coordinates of the upper left hand corner (center of the first voxel transmitted) of the image, in mm. See C.7.6.2.1.1 for further explanation.</description>
      <section ref="C.7.6.2.1.1" name="">The Image Position (0020,0032) specifies the x, y, and z coordinates of the upper left hand corner of the image; it is the center of the first voxel transmitted. Image Orientation (0020,0037) specifies the direction cosines of the first row and the first column with respect to the patient. These Attributes shall be provide as a pair. Row value for the x, y, and z axes respectively followed by the Column value for the x, y, and z axes respectively.
The direction of the axes is defined fully by the patient’s orientation. The x-axis is increasing to the left hand side of the patient. The y-axis is increasing to the posterior side of the patient. The z-axis is increasing toward the head of the patient.
The patient based coordinate system is a right handed system, i.e. the vector cross product of a unit vector along the positive x-axis and a unit vector along the positive y-axis is equal to a unit vector along the positive z-axis.
Note  If a patient lies parallel to the ground, face-up on the table, with his feet-to-head direction same as the front-to-back direction of the imaging equipment, the direction of the axes of this patient based coordinate system and the equipment based coordinate system in previous versions of this Standard will coincide.

The Image Plane Attributes, in conjunction with the Pixel Spacing Attribute, describe the position and orientation of the image slices relative to the patient-based coordinate system. In each image frame the Image Position (Patient) (0020,0032) specifies the origin of the image with respect to the patient-based coordinate system. RCS and the Image Orientation (Patient) (0020,0037) attribute values specify the orientation of the image frame rows and columns. The mapping of pixel location  to the RCS is calculated as follows:

P rSub { size 8{y} }  {} ##
P rSub { size 8{z} }  {} ##

Where:
Pxyz  The coordinates of the voxel (i,j) in the frame’s image plane in units of mm.
Sxyz  The three values of the Image Position (Patient) (0020,0032) attributes. It is the location in mm from the origin of the RCS.
Xxyz  The values from the row (X) direction cosine of the Image Orientation (Patient) (0020,0037) attribute.
Yxyz  The values from the column (Y) direction cosine of the Image Orientation (Patient) (0020,0037) attribute.
i    Column index to the image plane. The first column is index zero.
i  Column pixel resolution of the Pixel Spacing (0028,0030) attribute in units of mm.
j    Row index to the image plane. The first row index is zero.
j  Row pixel resolution of the Pixel Spacing (0028,0030) attribute in units of mm.

Additional constraints apply:
1)  The row and column direction cosine vectors shall be orthogonal, i.e. their dot product shall be zero.
2)  The row and column direction cosine vectors shall be normal, i.e. the dot product of each direction cosine vector with itself shall be unity.

      <section ref="C.8.5.5.1.3" name="">Region Flags (0018,6016) specify characteristics of US Regions.
Bit 0 of the Region Flags specifies the relative priority of the pixel component calibration specified by an US Region in the case where the US Region intersects with other US Regions. The calibration supplied by one or more of the regions may not be valid in the area that they intersect. Enumerated Values for Bit 0 (lsb):
  1 = Region pixels are low priority
  0 = Region pixels are high priority
A high priority region overwrites data of a low priority region when they overlap, thus invalidating any pixel component calibration specified for a low priority region. pixel component calibration of overlapping regions of the same priority is indeterminate where they overlap. Figure C.8-6 shows an example of intersecting regions.


Figure C.8-6
 Intersecting Spatial Format Regions and Overlapping Measurement
In this example, Region B is Color Flow while Region A is Tissue Echo. If Region B Color Flow values share the same bit planes as Region A Tissue Echo values, then it is indeterminate whether a pixel in this region is a Color Flow pixel or a Tissue Echo pixel. Since the pixels of the Color Flow region overwrite those of the Tissue Echo region, the Region Flag of the Tissue Echo region is assigned low priority and the Region Flag of the color region is assigned high priority. This means that if both the Tissue Echo and Color Flow regions define pixel component calibration that only the calibration specified by the Color Flow region can be applied to the pixel data value at Point X.
The measurement in Figure C.8-6 is a line between Point Y and Point Z. Both points are in Region A so the distance between them can be calculated using the Region A scaling (assuming that Region A defines both the Physical Units X Direction and Y Direction as being cm). If the points are in Region B, and hence also in Region A, it is still possible to calculate the distance because the region scaling is identical in both regions. The lower priority of Region B only applies to its pixel component calibration, not its X and Y direction scaling.
Enumerated Values for Bit 1 Scaling Protection:
  1 = Protected
  0 = Not Protected
Ultrasound systems should set this to 1 if the image is scaled automatically by the ultrasound system. If the image is frame-grabbed and scaling is not available then it should be set to 0. If the region is protected, the region can not be manually rescaled. That is the data defined by the region calibration Module can not be overridden by a reader of that image.

An example of Component Calibration for an ultrasound image is shown in Figure C.8-8.

Pixel Component Calibration Example
In this example, some pixels lie within two Regions. One Region specifies pixel component calibration for Doppler velocity values. The second Region specifies pixel component calibration for Doppler magnitude. A particular Pixel Data (7FE0,0010) value will thus map to a displayed value, a Doppler velocity and magnitude value.
The example has a Palette Color Photometric Interpretation with 16 Bits Allocated and Bits Stored per sample. The Palette Color Lookup Tables also have 16 bits for each entry. The fact that the example has just one sample per pixel means that each composite pixel value is identical to the single Pixel Data value. An example Pixel Data value is shown in brackets along with the output values resulting from each step where it is processed.
The Pixel Data value is mapped to red, green, and blue values from the supplied Palette Color Lookup Tables before being displayed. The display device supports 8 bits per sample and thus requires the scaling of the output values from the 16 bit per entry LUTs.
The Doppler Velocity Region maps each pixel value in the Region to the Doppler velocity. The Pixel Component Organization (0018,6044) has a value of zero, indicating bit aligned positions with a bit mask. The Pixel Component Mask (0018,6046) specifies that the least significant 4 bits of the most significant byte convey the Doppler velocity of each pixel. The Pixel Component Physical Units (0018,604C) are cm/sec, and the Pixel Component Data Type (0018,604E) indicates color flow velocity. The Table of X Break Points (0018,6052) and Table of Y Break Points (0018,6054) map each masked composite pixel value to a Doppler velocity value in cm/sec.
The Doppler Magnitude Region maps each pixel value in the Region to the Doppler magnitude. The Pixel Component Organization (0018,6044) has a value of zero, indicating bit aligned positions with a bit mask. The Pixel Component Mask (0018,6046) specifies that the most significant 4 bits of the most significant byte convey the Doppler magnitude of each pixel. The Pixel Component Physical Units (0018,604C) is set to dB, and the Pixel Component Data Type (0018,604E) indicates color flow magnitude. The Table of X Break Points (0018,6052) and Table of Y Break Points (0018,6054) map each masked composite pixel value to a Doppler magnitude value in dB.

      <section ref="C.7.6.1.1.5" name="">The Attribute Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) conveys that the Image has undergone lossy compression. It provides a means to record that the Image has been compressed (at a point in its lifetime) with a lossy algorithm and changes have been introduced into the pixel data. Once the value has been set to “01”, it shall not be reset.
Note:  If an image is compressed with a lossy algorithm, the attribute Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) is set to “01”. Subsequently, if the image is decompressed and transferred in uncompressed format, this attribute value remains “01”.

The value of the Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) Attribute in SOP Instances containing multiple frames in which one or more of the frames have undergone lossy compression shall be “01”.
Note:  It is recommended that the applicable frames be noted in the Attribute Derivation Description (0008,2111).

If an image is originally obtained as a lossy compressed image from the sensor, then Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) is set to “01” and Value 1 of the Attribute Image Type (0008,0008) shall be set to ORIGINAL.
If an image is a compressed version of another image, Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) is set to “01”, Value 1 of the Attribute Image Type (0008,0008) shall be set to DERIVED, and if the predecessor was a DICOM image, then the Image shall receive a new SOP Instance UID.
Note:  1. It is recommended that the approximate compression ratio be provided in the Attribute Derivation Description (0008,2111). Furthermore, it is recommended that Derivation Description (0008,2111) be used to indicate when pixel data changes might affect professional interpretation. (see C.7.6.1.1.3).
  2. The attribute Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) is defined as Type 3 for backward compatibility with existing IODs. It is expected to be required (i.e., defined as Type 1C) for new Image IODs and for existing IODs that undergo a major revision (e.g. a new IOD is specified).

  2. The attribute Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) is defined as Type 3 for backward compatibility with existing IODs. It is expected to be required (i.e., defined as Type 1C) for new Image IODs and for existing IODs that undergo a major revision (e.g. a new IOD is specified).
The Defined Terms for Lossy Image Compression Method (0028,2114) are:
ISO_10918_1 = JPEG Lossy Compression
ISO_14495_1 = JPEG-LS Near-lossless Compression
ISO_15444_1 = JPEG 2000 Irreversible Compression
ISO_13818_2 = MPEG2 Compression

This is intended for SOP Instances whose preferred clinical presentation is dependent on frame relationships other than simply time.
Defined Terms for multiframe cine from the Cine Module (see C.7.6.5) are:

Defined Terms for an arbitrary labeled increment:

Notes:  1. Previous editions of the standard did not include the optional Frame Dimension Pointer (0028,000A), but instead depended entirely on the mandatory Frame Increment Pointer (0028,0009), and envisaged that only time and no other dimension would relate frames. Image creators that add the Frame Dimension Pointer (0028,000A) must anticipate that many implementations will ignore or discard this attribute when displaying or storing images and continue to assume that frames are temporally related.
  2. Frame Time (0018,1063) or Frame Time Vector (0018,1065) will also be present and will contain appropriate values consistent with the times of acquisition of the frames.

The Positioner Primary Angle definition is like longitude (in the equatorial plan); the Positioner Secondary Angle definition is like latitude (in the sagittal plane). The Positioner Angle attributes apply to the first frame of a multi-frame image. The valid range of Primary Positioner Angle is -180 to +180 degrees and the Secondary Positioner Angle range is -90 to + 90 degrees.
The Patient Plane is defined by the isocenter of the imaging device and slices through the patient such that it is perpendicular to the sagittal plane of the body. The Primary Axis of rotation is defined at the intersection of the Patient Plane and of the Sagittal Plane. The Positioner Primary Angle is defined in the transaxial plane at the isocenter with zero degrees in the direction perpendicular to the patient's chest and + 90 degrees at the Patient left hand side (LAO) and -90 at the Patient right hand side (RAO). The valid range of Primary Positioner Angle is -180 to +180 degrees.
The Secondary Axis is in the Patient Plane and is perpendicular to the Primary Axis at the isocenter. The Positioner Secondary Angle is defined in the Sagittal Plane at the isocenter with zero degrees in the direction perpendicular to the patient's chest. +90 degrees corresponds to the cranial direction. The Secondary Positioner Angle range is -90 to + 90 degrees.
At a 0 angle for both the Primary Angle (0018,1510) and Secondary Angle (0018,1511), the patient faces the Image Intensifier.
The Positioner Primary Angle (0018,1510) and Secondary Angle (0018,1511) apply to the first frame of a multi-frame image.
